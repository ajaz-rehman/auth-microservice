# Auth Microservice

## Description

This project provides all authentication backend functionality and relevant endpoints. It also handles access and refresh tokens. Additionally, users can authenticate using Google, Microsoft, and GitHub accounts.

## Why?

I've developed a lot of projects from scratch and authentication has always been a primary element of pretty much every commercial API I've built. Rather than developing custom auth every time or using existing libraries, I wanted to have a quicker way of adding solid authentication to my projects easily. That's why I decided to build this auth microservice that I can easily use with any future project without having to write a single line of code. It's a drop in replacement that you can customize based on your needs.
